    <h1> Cyborg Love Story</h1>
    <div class="info"> Group project responding to Donna Haraways "Cyborg Manifesto".
    This is two videos showing one side from a machines POV and the POV of s girl who
  stumbles into the machine. In the end the become one learning that the true meaning
of love is to understand one another. This was originally presented on two different
tvs with two different sounds. My job on this project was setting up the room where
it took place, filming, and editting the machine POV side of the video (the right video).</div>
