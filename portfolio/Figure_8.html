    <div class="info"> Motion graphics music video made to FKA Twigs' <i> Figure 8 </i>
      This piece is about the artist revisting their old style as a means of finding
      themselves and allowing for artistic liberation. The "muses" of the videos
      were created in 2017 under the <a href = "acidPortInfo.html"> Acid Portraits </a>
      projects and were revisted in 2020 for this video.
