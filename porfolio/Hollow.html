  <h1> Hollow </h1>
  <div class = "info">
    In the beginning of Mark J.P. Wolf's <i> Building Imaginary Worlds: The Theory
      and History of Subcreation </i>, Wolf insinuates that children are the best world builders,
      and childhood instances of world building or <q>worldplay</q> could point to signs
      of creative genius. This idea brought me back to all the imaginary worlds I played
      in as a kid. Hollow was one of those worlds.
      <i>Hollow</i> is my University of Southern California Media Arts+Pratice degree's final thesis
      project.

      When I was a girl, there was a tree named  Hollow . But this wasn't any ordinary tree.
      It was a portal into another world, the world of Hollow.

      <div class="info_4"> There was a war. The two forces fought against eachother in a
        battle so extraordinary, even the grand council, the overseeing government of the Hollow
        world found out. </div>

        <div class="info_5"> As punishment, they took down our tree, banning all magic
        from our land. But I will always remember the creatures that lived there and the
      adventures we all had. </div>
