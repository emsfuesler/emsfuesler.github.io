      <h4> Project 000</h4>
      Transmedia world building project building off of ideas
    from Plato's Allegory of a Cave. This story follows a robot named Zero who
  was thrown away after not properly functioning and has lived in the sewers
building a society from the ground up. Hoping to find a better life while still being
frightened by the outside world, Zero reaches out to its internet friend (the audience).
This becomes a game where the audience interacts with Zero in hope of helping it and the
society overcome their fears of the outside world.
