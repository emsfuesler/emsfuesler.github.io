    In the beginning of Mark J.P. Wolf's <i> Building Imaginary Worlds: The Theory
      and History of Subcreation </i>, Wolf insinuates that children are the best world builders,
      and childhood instances of world building or <q>worldplay</q> could point to signs
      of creative genius. This idea brought me back to all the imaginary worlds I played
      in as a kid. Hollow was one of those worlds.
      <i>Hollow</i> is my University of Southern California Media Arts+Pratice degree's final thesis
      project.

      When I was a girl, there was a tree named  Hollow . But this wasn't any ordinary tree.
      It was a portal into another world, the world of Hollow.

    <div class="scene_2"> <img src = "hollow/floraFauna.png"> </div>
    <div class="info"> Hollow was a peacefull land of fairies and magic, where magical
      creatures roamed about and lived in prosperity with the wizards and sorceresses</div>
      <div class="scene_2"> <img src = "hollow/scene_1_final.png"> </div>
      <div class="info"> The tree was home to all who lived there. It's that magical
        epicenter of the land, supplying the land and all its dwellers with magical powers.

          a society of the forbidden arts, attacked beginning a war between the two lands. </div>

          <div class =  "info"> Eventually, The Grand Council, the overseeing rulers of all the land,
            found out about this horrid misuse of magic, and decided to ban magic as punishment.
            They uprooted the Hollow tree, our portal into the world, and cut off our access
            to all the magic and creatures within it.  </div>
