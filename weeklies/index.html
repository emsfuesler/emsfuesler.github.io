  <h1> Weekly 2 </h1>
  <h3> How was the internet shaped by objectivism?</h3>
  <p> I think part of what makes objectivism at least partially accessible
  on the internet is the lack of identity or the lack of a body in this
  sort of new order via an online community. Of course, that's kind of an
illusion. Everyone is still themselves behind the screen, but the internet
becomes a window to another society really, with its own regulations and
balances, where one is able to be more rational because they get to break from
thier daily life's roles of being a functioning member in society's machine:
in other words, the internet doesn't really require an agenda, you have the
power to use it for you and no one else which is the main philosophy of objectivism.
While objectivism was involved in shaping the internet, I also don't think it is
entirely possible, especially tpday when we know a lot of the things we do on the
internet are being monitored, and large corpoartions are the ones controlling
what we see despite many believing that the algorithms on the internet are purely
that unbiased data.

 <p> I was really excited to see that this weeks reading was
   Steyerl's <q>In Defense of the Poor Image</q>. I've actually read this
   before not for class but as a way of learning how to defend my own art.
   A lot of the art I create revolves around pop and internet culture, and
   there's been many times in my second major where I've been attacked for
   creating <em> low-brow </em> art in a high-brow setting ie. a gallery space
   or art insitution. Graduate student Casey Kauffman also works completely in
   internet culture and recommended this reading to me. Her practice lives almost
   entirely on Instagram @uncannysfvalley where she creates low quality collages
   and After Effects videos challenging the idea of a <q>Valley Girl</q> personality.
   She uses this theory in her practice a lot, because despite knowing how to
   use things like Photoshop, she still choses to make her pieces on a collaging,
   app on her phone. All her collages are made with found pop culture images,
   memes, etc. and they are all very low resolution. Furthermore, the defense of
   her poor image also comes about by the fact that she still puts these pieces
   in gallery exhibitions. She's done this two different ways, either displayed
   as a grid in a sort of homage to the Instagram layout, or she's also done
   it where she mounts phones and iPads to the walls and the audience is able to
   scroll through her Instagram. There's meaning made in bringing something like
   that into a gallery space and the input and critique she has given me in
   bringing meaning to my own work that is often attacked for having no meaning
   has helped me develop my own practice and the way I represent it.

 <h1> Weekly 4 </h1>
 <h3> Do you think humans can be understood through cybernetics?</h3>
 <p> I've been working on a project for the past 4 onths that about
 understanding yourself and your place in the world via communication with a
robot. It may even be what I pursue for my MAP thesis project. Basically,
you communicate through a chatroom-like game with a robot and try to help it
figure out it's place in the world, however along the way it also asserts that
the two of you are not so different. In fact, you seem just a socially coded as
it is. If I were to delve into the project, you could see the way that it exposes
social constructs and challenges the idea of the indiviual as well as critiquing
capitalism along the way. But, to stay on track with this weekly, I want to
to put this video in discussion with Katherine Hayles <q> Towards Embodied Virtuality</q>
which I used as a piece of research for this project. With this essay, I was able
to better understand ideas I had a hard time understanding in the past, as she
explained the similarity between humans and cyborgs in a more digestable way.
Between that essay, and this video, I do believewe can understand humans better
through cybernetics, because we too--our ideas, existence, and understanding--
is all coded.</p>

<h1> Weekly 4 </h1>
<p> This was a really interesting reading, especially because I am going it late
(3/22/2020) and given the state of the world right now--what we could refer to
as a <q> catastrophe </q> it's interesting to see how part 1 of the manifesto
pertains to this, especially as my email begins to fill with new COVID-19 themed
clothing lines from brands like H&M and Nordstroms.
For this weekly response, I actually want to talk about my MA+P
thesis project, because it is extremely relevent (I may even add this to my list
of research sources). My thesis is a transmedia narrative about a little robot
trying to find its place in the world. It's name is Zero, and it was created to
do remedial tasks and to increase the efficiency of the everyday business man.
Zero gets lost and talks to you over the internet (using a coded chatroom) confused
as to why it always feels the need to work, yet never feels satisfied, eventually
insinuating that you and Zero are not so different. </p>

<p> One of my biggest challenges creating this project relates to accelerationism
  in a lot of ways. To widen my audience for the project, I wanted to create a story
  that wasn't necessarily anticaptitalist, but moreso advocated for a more humane
  form of capitalism. <q> Sacred Economics </q> as refered to by <a href="https://vimeo.com/36843721">
    Charles Eisenstein </a> advocates for a more ethical form of capitalism, which
    is more likely to be successful because of the fear people have in regard to change,
    society, and even the mere word <q> socialism </q>. Its hard to begin change
    when people fear the change to begin with. Looking back at the question about
    the difference between speed and accelation in this instance, I begin to think
    back on my days as a Calc 2 tutor. Position in relation to this world mean a shift.
    Not a shift over time, just a shift, from capitalism directly into something
    different. Speed would be a change over time. A slow and steady change to your goal.
    and thenn acceleration would be the rate that the change occurs. Acceration doesn't
    have a goal of changing to meet an end or in this case position. The goal is
    the change itself. How fast can we make change? Thats what will lead to a real shift.
    Not defining reaching the end itself as the goal but rather the goal is the
    process. Im excited to use this reading in reference to my thesis, because
    I think this would be a great way to help me overcome my most difficult
    challenge in building this narrative.</p>
