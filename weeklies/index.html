    <div class ="h3"> How was the internet shaped by objectivism?</div>
    <div class= "box_1"> I think part of what makes objectivism at least partially accessible
    on the internet is the lack of identity or the lack of a body in this
    sort of new order via an online community. Of course, that's kind of an
  illusion. Everyone is still themselves behind the screen, but the internet
becomes a window to another society really, with its own regulations and
balances, where one is able to be more rational because they get to break from
thier daily life's roles of being a functioning member in society's machine:
in other words, the internet doesn't really require an agenda, you have the
power to use it for you and no one else which is the main philosophy of objectivism.
While objectivism was involved in shaping the internet, I also don't think it is
entirely possible, especially tpday when we know a lot of the things we do on the
internet are being monitored, and large corpoartions are the ones controlling
what we see despite many believing that the algorithms on the internet are purely
that unbiased data.

   <div class = "h3" > In Defense of the Poor Image. </div>
   <div class= "p"> I was really excited to see that this weeks reading was
     Steyerl's <q>In Defense of the Poor Image</q>. I've actually read this
     before not for class but as a way of learning how to defend my own art.
     A lot of the art I create revolves around pop and internet culture, and
     there's been many times in my second major where I've been attacked for
     creating <em> low-brow </em> art in a high-brow setting ie. a gallery space
     or art insitution. Graduate student Casey Kauffman also works completely in
     internet culture and recommended this reading to me. Her practice lives almost
     entirely on Instagram @uncannysfvalley where she creates low quality collages
     and After Effects videos challenging the idea of a <q>Valley Girl</q> personality.
     She uses this theory in her practice a lot, because despite knowing how to
     use things like Photoshop, she still choses to make her pieces on a collaging,
     app on her phone. All her collages are made with found pop culture images,
     memes, etc. and they are all very low resolution. Furthermore, the defense of
     her poor image also comes about by the fact that she still puts these pieces
     in gallery exhibitions. She's done this two different ways, either displayed
     as a grid in a sort of homage to the Instagram layout, or she's also done
     it where she mounts phones and iPads to the walls and the audience is able to
     scroll through her Instagram. There's meaning made in bringing something like
     that into a gallery space and the input and critique she has given me in
     bringing meaning to my own work that is often attacked for having no meaning
     has helped me develop my own practice and the way I represent it.
