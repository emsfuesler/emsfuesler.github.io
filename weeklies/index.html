    <h3.h1> How was the internet shaped by objectivism? </h3>
    <p.p1> I think part of what makes objectivism at least partially accessable
    on the internet is the lack of identity or the lack of a body in this
    sort of new order via an online community. Of course, that's kind of an
  illusion. Everyone is still themselves behind the screen, but the internet
becomes a window to another society really, with its own regulations and
balances, where one is able to be more rational because they get to break from
thier daily lifes roles of being a functioning member in societies machine:
in other words, the internet doesn't really require an agenda, you have the
power to use it for you and no one else which is the main philosphy of objectivism
