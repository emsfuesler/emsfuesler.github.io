	<div id="end"> You've made it, but this is only the beginning, it's something
	you will carry with you for the rest of your life. And you'll need to deal with it,
	but it doesn't define you. Yes, it makes you different, but not othered. It makes you, you
	and maybe that means taking extra time to care for yourself. Someone once told me that
	those who are othered love themselve like alcoholics. They're still them, but theres something
	about them that needs to be fixed. We need to learn to love ourselves less like alcoholics,
	and more like someone who is left handed. You don't need to change, you just do things differently,
	and it still makes you, you </div>
